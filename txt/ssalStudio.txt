Studio

The SSAL studio is my personal laboratory (with occasional outside projects) for the creation and recording of works which feature spatialized acoustic and/or electronic sounds. I designed the acoustic treatment system for the main SSAL recording room to be completely modular and mobile, and it has been installed in rooms in Madison, WI 2010–2013, and Placitas, NM 2014–2017. In 2018, I moved to my current location in New Glarus, WI. A new recording space at the current location will be completed in 2027.

Albums are available as physical media (while supplied last) and downloads at Bandcamp.
