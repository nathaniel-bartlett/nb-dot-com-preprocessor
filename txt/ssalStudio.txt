Studio

The SSAL studio is my personal laboratory (with occasional outside projects) for the creation and recording of works which feature spatialized acoustic and/or electronic sounds. I designed the acoustic treatment system for the main SSAL recording room to be completely modular and mobile, and it has been installed in rooms in Madison, WI 2010–2013, and Placitas, NM 2014–2017. In 2017, I moved back to Madison, WI, and am currently searching for a new space.

Albums are available as physical media and downloads at Bandcamp.
