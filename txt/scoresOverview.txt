Overview

In addition to my works which employ electronically generated sound and real-time scores, I also write purely acoustic works -- with a special emphasis on percussion instruments -- using paper-and-ink scores. To clearly and accurately represent my musical ideas in written form, I have devised a special notation system. The system uses multiple colors and other graphic devices in order to achieve maximum clarity, and is in general an attempt to visually represent the artistic sensibilities of the music for the performers as intuitively as possible. A guide to the notation system in included at the beginning of each score.
