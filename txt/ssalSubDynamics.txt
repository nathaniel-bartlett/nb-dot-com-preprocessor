True Dynamics

SSAL recordings, as a reflection of my musical aesthetics, are highly dynamic recordings. In other words, there is a huge range between the softest and loudest sounds. No dynamic range compression is used. The PDF notes accompanying the recordings give directions for setting playback levels based on the loudest section in the composition.
