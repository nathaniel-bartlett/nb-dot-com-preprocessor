Concert Presentation

SSAL recordings are not solely intended for home listening, I also conceive of them as fixed-media sound works that can be projected in a concert or installation setting. Multi-channel home-listening setups are still rare, especially eight-channel cube setups, so public presentations of SSAL recordings are the way most people hear these works in their true three-dimensional, high-definition format. If you are interested in acquiring the rights to present a SSAL recording publicly, please email me.
