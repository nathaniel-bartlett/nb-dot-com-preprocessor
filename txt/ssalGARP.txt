Guest Artist Recording Project

For performers of contemporary music, funding for the commissioning and recording of new works is extremely hard to secure. To get around this problem, I started the Sound-Space Audio Lab Guest Artist Recording Project. The SSAL_GARP, an exchange of time and talent, is simple: if you are a professional-caliber performer or ensemble, and can get yourself and your instruments to my studio, I will write a new work for you to record, in high-definition surround, for release on my Sound-Space Audio Lab record label.
