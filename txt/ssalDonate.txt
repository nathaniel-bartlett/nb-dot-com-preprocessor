Donate

Through my fiscal sponsor, Fractured Atlas, contributions to my projects are tax-deductable. In addition to monetary donations, I can also accept donations of physical property such as audio electronics or other materials directly related to my projects. If you are interested in starting a conversation about supporting my work, please be in touch.
